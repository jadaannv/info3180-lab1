   <h1>Jada-Ann Vite</h1> 
   <p>I am a 23 year old Applied Chemistry major. My interests include
    reading, nature and baking. My favourite part of the day is watching
    the sunset. Career wise, I hope to explore the chemical side of waste 
    water management or to become a chemical data analyst, hence the minor
    in Information Technology.
